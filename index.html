                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>In September of 1998 I was born durring a hurricane. After 2 weeks I was allowed to fly
                        home from Florida, with my new parents, where I grew up with a little brother. From a
                        young age I had a strong facination with the sciences and technology. Taking apart anything
                        I could get my hands on, from remote control cars, to playing on my grandmas computer, and making basic
                        web pages. My strong suit all throughout school was the sciences and math. I also played 
                        lacrosse and football at Fair lawn High School throughout elementary and middle school.
                        In middle school I would learn how to snowboard, leading me to move to Colorado from the age of 22 - 25.
                        I love to learn about new and interesting topics and I love to explore; always looking for a new adventure.

            <div id="Snowboarding">
                <h2>Snowboarding</h2>
                <p>My first time on a snowboard was at Shawnee ski resort in Pennsylvania, at age 9.
                    From the beginning I was hooked. I spent as much time on the mountain as I could.
                    In high school I joined Ski Club, and continued all the way to graduation. 
                    By that point, I was a good snowboarder and was extremely well versed in the activity.
                    I went on to persue a career at Ski Barn and Big Snow in North New Jersey. After five
                    years of hard work and extensive education in all things ski and snowboard, I decided 
                    to move to Colorado in October 2021. From there my skills and knowlege in snowboarding 
                    exploded. I learned how to ride the most extreme terrain, and build my skills and abilities
                    off piste, and in the back country. I would spend many of my afternoons hiking in the backcountry 
                    around Loveland Ski Resort and the Continental Divide, averaging around 100 days a season. 
                    After 3 years and over 20 different resorts over the Western United States, 
                    I feel confident riding any terrain and difficulty, having done a helicoper drop just prior
                    to moving back to the tristate. Snowboarding is a large part of my life and I look forward 
                    to many amazing days on the hill!</p>

                <h2>Adventurer</h2>
                <p>Ever since I was young exploring my neighborhood, climbing trees, and camping with the 
                    Boy Scouts, I've always had a drive toward adventure. I have a love for the outdoors, 
                    camping and hiking all over the United States. I've climbed 14,000 foot mountains, 
                    explored over 7 national parks, and spent a lot of time hiking to backcountry 
                    snowboard lines. I am always looking for my next adventure, I love seeing new sights, 
                    and going new cool places. Having been to over 20 states and 4 countries, I continually 
                    hunt for oppertunities to add more locations to the list of what I have explored.</p>

                <p>Often times in my free time I enjoy learning, be it about history, geology, science, or 
                    technology. I often find myself watching documentaries and videos made on Youtube. 
                    Some of the topics I most often find myself learning about include: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>History of humankind</li>
                        <li>History of life and of the universe</li>
                        <li>Geography and geology of earth and other planets</li>
                        <li>The science of space, and space travel</li>
                        <li>Quantum physics, general relativity, fluid dynamics and more</li>
                        <li>Technology like computers and coding projects.</li>
                        <li>Engineering like building rockets or engines.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This list serves as a brief overview of things that I enjoy learning about.
                        My desire to learn is like my desire for adventure, it knows no bounds.</p>

                <p>I would spend my summers as a kid at my grandmas house, spending many days on her computer.
                    It is here that I fostered my love of computer science. From downloading and playing games for 
                    many hours at a time, to building basic websites and learning how to naviage computers skillfully 
                    and building my problem solving skills. I became comefortable with breaking and fixing computer programs 
                    to bend them to my will and overcome problems. I enjoy the problem solving that computer programming presents,
                    and find it a strong and useful skill, from making and designing video games, to building websites like this one.

                    <p>Project Overview:</p>
                    <p>In this school project I was tasked with deciphering a series of words into a sentence based on reading a file which consisted of a set of number word pairs.</p>
                    <p>What I Learned:</p>
                    <p>I learned several important skills related to data processing, problem-solving, and aspects of coding as well. One of the key lessons I learned was how to parse and read data from a file. This is an essential skill in programming and working with data, as files often contain structured or unstructured information that needs to be processed.</p>

                    <p>This Project was a class that had its focus on learning and working with different algorithms and data structures. The task was to create a parcel delivery system.</p>
                    <p>What I Learned:</p>
                    <p>I gained hands-on experience with a variety of data structures, algorithms, and Big O notation, each of which plays a crucial role in optimizing the performance of a program. Data structures, such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and hash tables, are essential for organizing and managing data in a way that allows for efficient access and modification.</p>

                    <p>This project is on development of the video game snake. 
                        The purpose of this game is to expand my c++ skills and practice.</p>
                    <p>What I Learned:</p>
                    <p>I practised executing a project structure that is scalable for larger projects as the projects begin getting more complicated. 
                        Additionally I began to explore the use of custom code snippets in vs code, specifically boilerplate code for c++.
                        Finally, I explored multi-threaded coding practices in C++.</p>

                        play Rock, Paper, Scissors.</p>
                    <p>What I Learned:</p>
                    <p>This project was brought about as a result of my desire to expand my knowledge about vs code's debugger when
                        dealing with C++, and to expand my understanding of different random number generators.

                    <p>What I learned:</p>
                    <p>This project served as a valuable refresher in node.js as it has been a while since my last node project.
                        It also served as a good introductory project for web scraping as I have never tried this before.

                    <p>Built a class roster program that manages student information and adds it to a roster. 
                        This roster has the ability to sort by degree program and by invalid email. It can make 
                        new students, and average the days it takes for each student to complete the course.</p>
                    <p>What I learned:</p>
                    <p>This was my first project in C++ or any language that uses pointers, and manual memory management.
                        Aside from this I expanded my understanding of computer science topics like object oriented programming, 
                        and writing good code.</p>
