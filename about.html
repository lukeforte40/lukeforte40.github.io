                <h1>A general overview</h1>
                <p>In September of 1998 I was born durring a hurricane. After 2 weeks I was allowed to fly
                    home from Florida, with my new parents, where I grew up with a little brother. From a
                    young age I had a strong facination with the sciences and technology. Taking apart anything
                    I could get my hands on, from remote control cars, to playing on my grandmas computer, and making basic
                    web pages. My strong suit all throughout school was the sciences and math. I also played 
                    lacrosse and football at Fair lawn High School throughout elementary and middle school.
                    In middle school I would learn how to snowboard, leading me to move to Colorado from the age of 22 - 25.
                    I love to learn about new and interesting topics and I love to explore; always looking for a new adventure.</p>

                <h1>Snowboarding</h1>
                <p>My first time on a snowboard was at Shawnee ski resort in Pennsylvania, at age 9.
                    From the beginning I was hooked. Spending as much time on the mountain as I could.
                    In high school I joined Ski club, and continued through to my graduation. 
                    By that piont I was a good snowboarder and was extremely well versed in the activity.
                    I went on to persue a career at Ski barn and Big Snow in North New Jersey. After five
                    years of hard work and extensive education in all things ski and snowboard, I decided 
                    to move to Colorado in October 2021. From there my skills and knowlege in snowboarding 
                    exploded. I learned how to ride the most extreme terrain, and build my skills and abilities
                    off piste, and in the back country. I would Spend many of my afternoons hiking in the backcountry 
                    around loveland ski resort and the continental divide, averaging around 100 days a season. 
                    After 3 years and over 20 different resorts over the western united states, 
                    I feel confident riding any terrain and difficulty, having done a helicoper drop just prior
                    to moving back to the tristate. Snowboarding is a large part of my life and I look forward 
                    to many amazing days on the hill!</p>
