                <h1>A general overview</h1>
                <p>In September of 1998 I was born durring a hurricane. After 2 weeks I was allowed to fly
                    home from Florida, with my new parents, where I grew up with a little brother. From a
                    young age I had a strong facination with the sciences and technology. Taking apart anything
                    I could get my hands on, from remote control cars, to playing on my grandmas computer, and making basic
                    web pages. My strong suit all throughout school was the sciences and math. I also played 
                    lacrosse and football at Fair lawn High School throughout elementary and middle school.
                    In middle school I would learn how to snowboard, leading me to move to Colorado from the age of 22 - 25.
                    I love to learn about new and interesting topics and I love to explore; always looking for a new adventure.</p>

            <div id="Snowboarding">
                <h1>Snowboarding</h1>
                <p>My first time on a snowboard was at Shawnee ski resort in Pennsylvania, at age 9.
                    From the beginning I was hooked. I spent as much time on the mountain as I could.
                    In high school I joined Ski Club, and continued all the way to graduation. 
                    By that point, I was a good snowboarder and was extremely well versed in the activity.
                    I went on to persue a career at Ski Barn and Big Snow in North New Jersey. After five
                    years of hard work and extensive education in all things ski and snowboard, I decided 
                    to move to Colorado in October 2021. From there my skills and knowlege in snowboarding 
                    exploded. I learned how to ride the most extreme terrain, and build my skills and abilities
                    off piste, and in the back country. I would spend many of my afternoons hiking in the backcountry 
                    around Loveland Ski Resort and the Continental Divide, averaging around 100 days a season. 
                    After 3 years and over 20 different resorts over the Western United States, 
                    I feel confident riding any terrain and difficulty, having done a helicoper drop just prior
                    to moving back to the tristate. Snowboarding is a large part of my life and I look forward 
                    to many amazing days on the hill!</p>

                <h1>Adventurer</h1>
                <p>Ever since I was young exploring my neighborhood, climbing trees, and camping with the 
                    Boy Scouts, I've always had a drive toward adventure. I have a love for the outdoors, 
                    camping and hiking all over the United States. I've climbed 14,000 foot mountains, 
                    explored over 7 national parks, and spent a lot of time hiking to backcountry 
                    snowboard lines. I am always looking for my next adventure, I love seeing new sights, 
                    and going new cool places. Having been to over 20 states and 4 countries, I continually 
                    hunt for oppertunities to add more locations to the list of what I have explored.</p>

                <p>Often times in my free time I enjoy learning, be it about history, geology, science, or 
                    technology. I often find myself watching documentaries and videos made on Youtube. 
                    Some of the topics I most often find myself learning about include: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>History of humankind</li>
                        <li>History of life and of the universe</li>
                        <li>Geography and geology of earth and other planets</li>
                        <li>The science of space, and space travel</li>
                        <li>Quantum physics, general relativity, fluid dynamics and more</li>
                        <li>Technology like computers and coding projects.</li>
                        <li>Engineering like building rockets or engines.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This list serves as a brief overview of things that I enjoy learning about.
                        My desire to learn is like my desire for adventure, it knows no bounds.</p>

                <h1>Computer Programmer</h1>
                <p>I would spend my summers as a kid at my grandmas house, spending many days on her computer.
                    It is here that I fostered my love of computer science. From downloading and playing games for 
                    many hours at a time, to building basic websites and learning how to naviage computers skillfully 
                    and building my problem solving skills. I became comefortable with breaking and fixing computer programs 
                    to bend them to my will and overcome problems. I enjoy the problem solving that computer programming presents,
                    and find it a strong and useful skill, from making and designing video games, to building websites like this one.
