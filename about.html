                <h1>A general overview</h1>
                <p>In September of 1998 I was born durring a hurricane. After 2 weeks I was allowed to fly
                    home from Florida, with my new parents, where I grew up with a little brother. From a
                    young age I had a strong facination with the sciences and technology. Taking apart anything
                    I could get my hands on, from remote control cars, to playing on my grandmas computer, and making basic
                    web pages. My strong suit all throughout school was the sciences and math. I also played 
                    lacrosse and football at Fair lawn High School throughout elementary and middle school.
                    In middle school I would learn how to snowboard, leading me to move to Colorado from the age of 22 - 25.
                    I love to learn about new and interesting topics and I love to explore; always looking for a new adventure.</p>
