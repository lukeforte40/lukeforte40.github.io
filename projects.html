                    <p>Project overview:</p>
                    <p>This website is to provide my resume, skills, and certifications. It showcases my current, previous,
                        and major projects, and provides a window to show who I am as a person and an employee.</p>
                    <p>What I Learned:</p>
                    <p>This website refreshed my memory on building websites, and working on front end web development.
                        This project was made to help me build my skills in html5, Css3, Javascript, and my writing skills.</p>

                    <p>Project overview:</p>
                    <p>Built a class roster program that manages student information and adds it to a roster. 
                        This roster has the ability to sort by degree program and by invalid email. It can make 
                        new students, and average the days it takes for each student to complete the course.</p>
                    <p>What I learned:</p>
                    <p>This was my first project in C++ or any language that uses pointers, and manual memory management.
                        Aside from this I expanded my understanding of computer science topics like object oriented programming, 
                        and writing good code.</p>
